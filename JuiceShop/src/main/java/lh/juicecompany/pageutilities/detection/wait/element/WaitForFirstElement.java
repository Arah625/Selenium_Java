 * such as waiting for any one of multiple success messages or buttons that might appear as a result of an action.

    /**
     * Waits for the visibility of at least one element from the specified elements. This version of the method
     * utilizes varargs for easier inline specification of elements to check for visibility. It's particularly
     * useful when you have a small, finite set of elements and you want the test to proceed as soon as any one of
     * these elements becomes visible on the page. This could be useful in scenarios where multiple outcomes are
     * possible and the appearance of any specific element indicates the test can move forward.
     *
     * @param fluentWait  The {@link FluentWait} configured with specific timeout and polling interval, adapting
     *                    the wait strategy to the dynamic nature of web elements' visibility.
     * @param webElements Varargs array of {@link WebElement} instances to check for visibility. This flexibility
     *                    allows for direct passing of multiple elements without needing a list.
     * @return True if any one of the provided elements becomes visible within the wait time defined in fluentWait;
     * false if none of the elements become visible within this period.
     * <p>
     * Example usage in a test case:
     * <pre>{@code
     * boolean isAnyElementVisible = WaitForAnyElement.waitForVisibilityOfAnyElement(
     *     WebDriverSetup.getInstance().getFluentWait(), submitButton, cancelButton, errorMessage);
     * assertTrue(isAnyElementVisible, "Expected at least one element to be visible but none were.");
     * }</pre>
     * This method is a versatile tool in handling conditional flows within a page, where the visibility
     * of different elements could lead to different paths in the test execution.
